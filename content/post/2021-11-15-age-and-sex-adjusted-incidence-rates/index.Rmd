In this first post I'm going to present a way of obtaining age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates using poisson regression in R. This will be similar to what is done in Stata as described [here](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1431921-age-adjusted-rates-using-a-poisson-regression).

I've written a R function that's available for download [here.](age_sex_adjust.R) The script can be sourced ( `source("age-sex-adjust.R"` ) and then the function `age_sex_adjust()` can be used as is. The code will also be described step by step below.

***

There are, as usual, several ways to calculate adjusted incidence rates in R. I've chosen to use the package [stdReg](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stdReg) by [Arvid Sj√∂lander](https://www.meb.ki.se/sites/arvsjo/) because it has a lot of nice features and useful implications in causal inference. Specifically, we will use the function `stdGlm()` from stdReg to generate the the adjusted incidence rates. 


But first we start off with a little bit of background on what an incidence rate is. It is simply a measure of a number of occurrences (a count) in a population over the total population time. For example, in a population of 10 people, each followed 1 year, there was one case of death. In that population, the incidence rate of death would 1 per 10 person years. In observational data, we often have larger cohorts with varying follow-up time and censoring.  The calculation is of course the same, using the formula below:   
<br>
$$\text{Incidence rate} = \frac{\text{Number of occurrences}}{\sum_{\text{Persons}}{\text{Time in study}}}$$
<br>

### Calculating crude incidence rate  

To illustrate, we will now use the `colon` dataset from the `survival` package. 


```{r message = FALSE}
library(survival)
library(dplyr)
library(broom)
```

Running `?survival::colon` tells us the following:

> Data from one of the first successful trials of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer  

Variable | Explanation
-------- | -----------
id | Patient id
study | 1 for all patients
rx | 1 for all patients
sex | 1 = male  
age | in years  
obstruct |colon obstruction by tumour  
perfor | performation of colon  
adhere | adherence to nearby organs  
nodes | number of positive lymph nodes  
time | days until event or censoring  
status | censoring status  
differ | tumour differentiation --- 1 = well, 2 = moderate, 3 = poor  
extent | extent of local spread --- 1 = submucosa, 2 = muscle, 3 = serosa, 4 = continious  
surg | time from surgery to registration --- 0 = short, 1 = long  
node4 | more than 4 positive lymph nodes  
etype | event type --- 1 = recurrence, 2 = death  

OK, so now that we understand the data, let's start calculating crude incidence rates for death among the different treatment groups:    

```{r message = FALSE}
# load the colon dataset
data(colon, package = "survival") 

# Only keep records related to the death outcome
colon_death <- colon %>% dplyr::filter(etype == 2) 

# Time is divided by 365.25/100 to get the time in days variable 
# first to years, then to 100 person-years

colon_death %>% group_by(rx) %>% 
                summarise(Events = sum(status), 
                          Time = sum(time/365.25/100), 
                          Rate = Events / Time, 
                          lower = poisson.test(Events, Time)$conf.int[1], 
                          upper = poisson.test(Events, Time)$conf.int[2])
```
Now we compare to the calculated rates with rates obtained from the `survRate()` function from the [biostat3](https://cran.r-project.org/package=biostat3) package:

```{r message = FALSE}

library(biostat3)
survRate(Surv(time/365.25/100, status) ~ rx, data = colon_death) %>% 
  dplyr::select(rx, event, tstop, rate, lower, upper) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  dplyr::rename(Events = event, 
                Time = tstop, 
                Rate = rate)

```
  
Good, the incidence rates are identical. The observational patients had an mortality incidence rate of 12.2 per 100 person-years, compared to the Lev+5-FU treated patients with an incidence rate of 8.22 per 100 person-years. Now, let's try and repeat these results with poisson regression. 


### Obtaining estimated incidence rates using poisson regression
  
  

Here we use the [broom](https://broom.tidymodels.org/) package `tidy` function to obtain exponentiated estimates:
  
  
```{r}
poisson_fit <- glm(status ~ rx + offset(log(time/365.25/100)), 
                   family = poisson, data = colon_death)
tidy(poisson_fit, exponentiate = T, conf.int = T)
```
The Intercept estimate here is the estimated IR for the reference level, i.e. the Obs group. 

To get estimated IR of Lev+5FU treated:

```{r}
lev_5fu <- predict(poisson_fit, 
                   newdata = data.frame(rx = "Lev+5FU", time = 36525), 
                   type = "link", se.fit = T)

as_tibble(lev_5fu) %>% summarise(Treatment = "Lev+5FU", 
                                 IR = exp(fit), 
                                 lower = exp(fit - (1.96 * se.fit)), 
                                 upper = exp(fit + (1.96 * se.fit)))

```
Here, the confidence interval needs to be calculated on the $\log$ scale and then exponentiated back. This will cause the confidence interval to not be centered around the estimate.  

A poisson model is actually modeling $\log\text{incidence rates (ratios)}$ when we use the time variable as an offset. Therefore, we can include covariates in the model to be accounted for, such as age and sex.

### Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates using poisson regression

First, we'll do it using my `age_sex_adjust()` function

```{r}
source("age-sex-adjust.R")
# Usage: age_sex_adjust(data, group, age, sex, event, time)

age_sex_adjust(colon_death, rx, age, sex, status, time)
```
Here we see that the adjusted rates are very similar to the crude rates calculated above. Since this data comes from a randomized trial, this is expected and can be taken as a sign that the randomization worked.  

Now, let's do the some thing but without using the ready made function to see how it works under the hood. 

```{r}
poisson_fit <- glm(status ~ rx * I(age^2) + sex, 
                   offset = log(time/365.25/100), 
                   data = colon_death, 
                   family = poisson)

std_fit <- stdGlm(poisson_fit, data = transform(colon_death, time = 36525), X = "rx")

std_sum <- summary(std_fit, CI.type = "log")

std_sum[["est.table"]] %>% 
    as_tibble(rownames = "rx") %>% 
    transmute(Treatment = rx, 
              IR = Estimate, 
              lower = `lower 0.95`, 
              upper = `upper 0.95`)

```
The numbers are identical to the ones obtained from the `age_sex_adjust()` function, which is logical since we did the same thing as the function does.  
A few finishing notes. Here I included age as a quadratic term, and as an interaction with exposure. These are modeling decisions one will have to take, however the model could have been only a main effects model such as:  
<br>
$$\log\lambda = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{age} + \beta_2\text{sex}$$ 
<br>
Regarding the interaction term, a good explanation was given in the Stata forum in [this](https://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/1431921-age-adjusted-rates-using-a-poisson-regression) post.
