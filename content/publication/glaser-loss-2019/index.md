abstract: 'Background Contemporary data on loss in life expectancy after aortic valve
  replacement (AVR) are scarce, particularly in younger patients. Objectives The purpose
  of this national, observational cohort study was to analyze long-term relative survival
  and estimated loss in life expectancy after AVR. Methods The study included 23,528
  patients who underwent primary surgical AVR with or without concomitant coronary
  artery bypass grafting in Sweden between 1995 and 2013 from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish
  Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease
  Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) register. Individual level linking
  with other national health-data registers was performed to obtain baseline characteristics
  and vital status. The expected survival from the general Swedish population matched
  by age, sex, and year of surgery was obtained from the Human Mortality Database.
  The relative survival was used as an estimate of cause-specific mortality. Flexible
  parametric models based on relative survival were used to estimate the loss in life
  expectancy. Results The mean follow-up was 6.8 years. The 19-year observed, expected,
  and relative survival was 21%, 34%, and 63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 59% to
  67%), respectively. The loss in life expectancy was 1.9 years (95% CI: 1.2 to 2.6
  years) in the total study population. The estimated loss in life expectancy increased
  with younger age: 0.4 years (95% CI: 0.3 to 0.5 years) versus 4.4 years (95% CI:
  1.5 to 7.2 years) in patients ≥80 and textless50 years of age, respectively. There
  was no difference in loss in life expectancy between men and women. Conclusions
  This study found a shorter life expectancy in patients after AVR compared with the
  general population. The estimated loss in life expectancy was substantial, and increased
  with younger age. These results provide important information to quantify disease
  burden after AVR, and are relevant for clinicians counseling patients before and
  after AVR. (HeAlth-data Register sTudies of Risk and Outcomes in Cardiac Surgery
