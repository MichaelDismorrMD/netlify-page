abstract: 'Background This study aimed to describe overall survival following pulmonary
  metastasectomy for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Sweden, and to assess the discrimination
  of a recently proposed risk prediction model.  Methods Individual-level data of
  756 patients who underwent resection of pulmonary metastases from CRC between 2009
  and 2015 were obtained from ThoR, a Swedish national quality register for thoracic
  surgery. We classified patients into three risk categories according to the number
  of preoperative risk factors [age, disease-free interval (DFI), presence of extrathoracic
  lesions, number of pulmonary metastases] established in a prior study. We estimated
  the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) by Cox regression and the
  restricted mean survival time difference as group contrast measures.  Results During
  a median follow-up time of 2.9 years, 35% (268/756) patients died. At 5 years, overall
  survival was 56% (95% CI: 51–60%). In a Cox regression model with risk category
  as the only independent variable, the HR for all-cause mortality was 1.94 (95% CI:
  1.38–2.72, Ptextless0.001) and 4.35 (95% CI: 2.49–7.62, Ptextless0.001) in the moderate-
  (n=558) and high-risk categories (n=32), respectively, versus the low-risk category
  (n=166). At 5 years, the differences in restricted mean survival time were 6 months
  (Ptextless0.001) and 1.5 years (Ptextless0.001) in the moderate- and high-risk categories,
  respectively, versus the low-risk category.  Conclusions Five-year survival after
  surgery for pulmonary metastases from CRC in Sweden was similar or higher compared
  with contemporary reports. A prognostic model, initially developed in Japanese patients,
  had excellent discrimination in an external validation cohort of Swedish patients.'
