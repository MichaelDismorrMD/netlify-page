abstract: Purpose of Review Several advances have been made in recent years to improve
  outcome for patients with coronary artery disease. One of the most debated topics
  regarding surgical treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is graft
  selection. This review aims to present the current status and scientific evidence
  for bilateral internal thoracic artery (BITA) grafting.  Recent Findings Observational
  studies and pooled analyses suggest that BITA grafting is associated with improved
  survival. Early results from a large randomized controlled trial report safety and
  efficacy of the method. The improved survival might be amplified in select groups,
  but with an increase in sternal wound-related complications. The benefit of BITA
  grafts seems to remain to an approximate age of 69Â years at surgery.  Summary CABG
  with BITA grafts is likely associated with improved long-term survival at a cost
  of an increase in sternal wound infections. Ten-year results from the Arterial Revascularization
  Trial are expected in 2018, providing the best evidence regarding the method yet.
  Early results show it is a safe method in most patient categories considerable for
  CABG.
