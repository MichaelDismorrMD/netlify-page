abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Blood type A antigen on porcine aortic bioprostheses might initiate
  an immune reaction leading to an increased frequency of structural valve deterioration
  in patients with blood type B or O. The aim was to analyse the association between
  ABO blood type and porcine bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration. DESIGN: Observational
  nationwide cohort study. SETTING: Swedish population-based study. PARTICIPANTS:
  Adult patients (n=3417) who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement and received
  porcine bioprosthetic aortic valves between 1995 and 2012 from the Swedish Web system
  for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated
  According to Recommended Therapies register. The study database was enriched with
  information from other national registers. EXPOSURE: The patients were categorised
  into type A/AB and type B/O blood groups. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:
  Primary outcome measure was aortic valve reoperation, and secondary outcomes were
  heart failure and all-cause mortality. We report risk estimates that account for
  the competing risk of death. RESULTS: In total, 3417 patients were identified: 1724
  (50.5%) with blood type A/AB and 1693 (49.5%) with blood type B/O. Both groups had
  similar baseline characteristics. The cumulative incidence of aortic valve reoperation
  was 3.4% (95% CI 2.5% to 4.4%) and 3.6% (95% CI 2.6% to 4.6%) in the type B/O and
  the A/AB group, respectively, at 15 years of follow-up (absolute risk difference:
  -0.2% (95% CI -1.5% to 1.2%)). There was no significantly increased risk for aortic
  valve reoperation in patients with blood type B/O compared with type A/AB (HR 0.95,
  95% CI 0.62 to 1.45). There was no significant difference in absolute or relative
  risk of heart failure or death between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant
  association between patient blood type and clinical manifestations of structural
  valve deterioration following porcine aortic valve replacement. Our findings suggest
  that it is safe to use porcine bioprosthetic valves without consideration of ABO
  blood type in the recipient. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT02276950.'
