abstract: 'Background Evidence for pulmonary metastasectomy following colorectal cancer
  (CRC) is scarce. The aim of the study was to investigate long-term survival and
  identify prognostic factors to aid patient selection.  Methods We included all patients
  who underwent pulmonary resections for CRC metastases between January 01, 2004 and
  December 31, 2015 in a population-based cohort study. The primary outcome measure
  was all-cause mortality and was ascertained from Swedish national registers. The
  Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to calculate cumulative survival. We used Cox regression
  for estimation of hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association
  between patient characteristics and survival.  Results We included 184 patients.
  The number of procedures per year increased from 1 in 2004 to 34 in 2015. During
  a median follow-up time of 3.2 years, 36% (66/184) patients died. Overall survival
  at 5 years was 60% (95% CI: 50–68%) and was significantly lower compared to an age-
  and gender-matched Swedish population. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was
  identified as a prognostic factor for mortality in the age and sex-adjusted analysis
  (HR, 2.46; 95% CI: 1.15–5.26, P=0.020).  Conclusions We found a steady increase
  in the number of pulmonary metastasectomies after CRC during the study period. We
  identified prethoracotomy CEA level as a prognostic factor for long-term survival,
  which was consistent with prior reports. The 5-year overall survival rate in our
  study was 60%, which was high in comparison with prior reports. Although our results
  indicated that current patient selection criteria were reasonable, definitive evidence
  of efficacy is pending.'
