abstract: OBJECTIVE To investigate long-term outcomes after primary surgical aortic
  valve replacement among patients who underwent postoperative permanent pacemaker
  implantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study included all patients
  who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement in Sweden from 1997 to 2018. All
  patients who underwent primary surgical aortic valve replacement in Sweden and survived
  the first 30 days after surgical treatment were included. Patients who underwent
  preoperative permanent pacemaker implantation, concomitant surgical treatment for
  another valve, or emergency surgical treatment were excluded. Patients who underwent
  concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting or surgical treatment of the ascending
  aorta were included. Follow-up data were complete for all patients. Data were analyzed
  from October through December 2020. EXPOSURES Patients underwent implantation of
  a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator within 30 days after
  aortic valve replacement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was all-cause
  mortality. RESULTS Among 24 983 patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement,
  849 patients (3.4%) underwent permanent pacemaker implantation within 30 days after
  surgical treatment and 24 134 patients (96.6%) did not receive pacemakers in that
  time. The mean (SD) age of the total study population was 69.7 (10.8) years, and
  9209 patients were women (36.9%). The mean (SD) and maximum follow-up periods were
  7.3 (5.0) years and 22.0 years, respectively. At 10 years and 20 years after surgical
  treatment, the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival rates were 52.8% and 18.0% in the
  pacemaker group, respectively, and 57.5% and 19.6% in the nonpacemaker group, respectively.
  All-cause mortality was statistically significantly increased in the pacemaker group
  compared with the nonpacemaker group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% CI, 1.01-1.29;
  P = .03), and so was risk of heart failure hospitalization (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.31-1.89;
  P textless .001). No statistically significant increase was found in the risk of
  endocarditis in the pacemaker group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found
  that there were increased risks of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization
  among patients who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation after surgical aortic
  valve replacement, suggesting that these risks are important considerations, especially
  in an era when transcatheter aortic valve replacement is used in younger patients
  at lower risk of adverse surgical outcomes. These findings further suggest that
