	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Blood type A antigen on porcine aortic bioprostheses might initiate an immune reaction leading to an increased frequency of structural valve deterioration in patients with blood type B or O. The aim was to analyse the association between ABO blood type and porcine bioprosthetic aortic valve degeneration.
DESIGN: Observational nationwide cohort study.
SETTING: Swedish population-based study.
PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (n=3417) who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement and received porcine bioprosthetic aortic valves between 1995 and 2012 from the Swedish Web system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies register. The study database was enriched with information from other national registers.
EXPOSURE: The patients were categorised into type A/AB and type B/O blood groups.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was aortic valve reoperation, and secondary outcomes were heart failure and all-cause mortality. We report risk estimates that account for the competing risk of death.
RESULTS: In total, 3417 patients were identified: 1724 (50.5\%) with blood type A/AB and 1693 (49.5\%) with blood type B/O. Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. The cumulative incidence of aortic valve reoperation was 3.4\% (95\% CI 2.5\% to 4.4\%) and 3.6\% (95\% CI 2.6\% to 4.6\%) in the type B/O and the A/AB group, respectively, at 15 years of follow-up (absolute risk difference: -0.2\% (95\% CI -1.5\% to 1.2\%)). There was no significantly increased risk for aortic valve reoperation in patients with blood type B/O compared with type A/AB (HR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.62 to 1.45). There was no significant difference in absolute or relative risk of heart failure or death between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant association between patient blood type and clinical manifestations of structural valve deterioration following porcine aortic valve replacement. Our findings suggest that it is safe to use porcine bioprosthetic valves without consideration of ABO blood type in the recipient.

	abstract = {Background
This study aimed to describe overall survival following pulmonary metastasectomy for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Sweden, and to assess the discrimination of a recently proposed risk prediction model.

Methods
Individual-level data of 756 patients who underwent resection of pulmonary metastases from CRC between 2009 and 2015 were obtained from ThoR, a Swedish national quality register for thoracic surgery. We classified patients into three risk categories according to the number of preoperative risk factors [age, disease-free interval (DFI), presence of extrathoracic lesions, number of pulmonary metastases] established in a prior study. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) by Cox regression and the restricted mean survival time difference as group contrast measures.

Results
During a median follow-up time of 2.9 years, 35\% (268/756) patients died. At 5 years, overall survival was 56\% (95\% CI: 51–60\%). In a Cox regression model with risk category as the only independent variable, the HR for all-cause mortality was 1.94 (95\% CI: 1.38–2.72, P{\textless}0.001) and 4.35 (95\% CI: 2.49–7.62, P{\textless}0.001) in the moderate- (n=558) and high-risk categories (n=32), respectively, versus the low-risk category (n=166). At 5 years, the differences in restricted mean survival time were 6 months (P{\textless}0.001) and 1.5 years (P{\textless}0.001) in the moderate- and high-risk categories, respectively, versus the low-risk category.

Conclusions
Five-year survival after surgery for pulmonary metastases from CRC in Sweden was similar or higher compared with contemporary reports. A prognostic model, initially developed in Japanese patients, had excellent discrimination in an external validation cohort of Swedish patients.},

	abstract = {Background
Contemporary data on loss in life expectancy after aortic valve replacement (AVR) are scarce, particularly in younger patients.
Objectives
The purpose of this national, observational cohort study was to analyze long-term relative survival and estimated loss in life expectancy after AVR.
Methods
The study included 23,528 patients who underwent primary surgical AVR with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting in Sweden between 1995 and 2013 from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) register. Individual level linking with other national health-data registers was performed to obtain baseline characteristics and vital status. The expected survival from the general Swedish population matched by age, sex, and year of surgery was obtained from the Human Mortality Database. The relative survival was used as an estimate of cause-specific mortality. Flexible parametric models based on relative survival were used to estimate the loss in life expectancy.
Results
The mean follow-up was 6.8 years. The 19-year observed, expected, and relative survival was 21\%, 34\%, and 63\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 59\% to 67\%), respectively. The loss in life expectancy was 1.9 years (95\% CI: 1.2 to 2.6 years) in the total study population. The estimated loss in life expectancy increased with younger age: 0.4 years (95\% CI: 0.3 to 0.5 years) versus 4.4 years (95\% CI: 1.5 to 7.2 years) in patients ≥80 and {\textless}50 years of age, respectively. There was no difference in loss in life expectancy between men and women.
Conclusions
This study found a shorter life expectancy in patients after AVR compared with the general population. The estimated loss in life expectancy was substantial, and increased with younger age. These results provide important information to quantify disease burden after AVR, and are relevant for clinicians counseling patients before and after AVR.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review
Several advances have been made in recent years to improve outcome for patients with coronary artery disease. One of the most debated topics regarding surgical treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is graft selection. This review aims to present the current status and scientific evidence for bilateral internal thoracic artery (BITA) grafting.

Recent Findings
Observational studies and pooled analyses suggest that BITA grafting is associated with improved survival. Early results from a large randomized controlled trial report safety and efficacy of the method. The improved survival might be amplified in select groups, but with an increase in sternal wound-related complications. The benefit of BITA grafts seems to remain to an approximate age of 69 years at surgery.

Summary
CABG with BITA grafts is likely associated with improved long-term survival at a cost of an increase in sternal wound infections. Ten-year results from the Arterial Revascularization Trial are expected in 2018, providing the best evidence regarding the method yet. Early results show it is a safe method in most patient categories considerable for CABG.},

	abstract = {Background
Evidence for pulmonary metastasectomy following colorectal cancer (CRC) is scarce. The aim of the study was to investigate long-term survival and identify prognostic factors to aid patient selection.

Methods
We included all patients who underwent pulmonary resections for CRC metastases between January 01, 2004 and December 31, 2015 in a population-based cohort study. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality and was ascertained from Swedish national registers. The Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to calculate cumulative survival. We used Cox regression for estimation of hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between patient characteristics and survival.

Results
We included 184 patients. The number of procedures per year increased from 1 in 2004 to 34 in 2015. During a median follow-up time of 3.2 years, 36\% (66/184) patients died. Overall survival at 5 years was 60\% (95\% CI: 50–68\%) and was significantly lower compared to an age- and gender-matched Swedish population. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was identified as a prognostic factor for mortality in the age and sex-adjusted analysis (HR, 2.46; 95\% CI: 1.15–5.26, P=0.020).

Conclusions
We found a steady increase in the number of pulmonary metastasectomies after CRC during the study period. We identified prethoracotomy CEA level as a prognostic factor for long-term survival, which was consistent with prior reports. The 5-year overall survival rate in our study was 60\%, which was high in comparison with prior reports. Although our results indicated that current patient selection criteria were reasonable, definitive evidence of efficacy is pending.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To investigate long-term outcomes after primary surgical aortic valve replacement among patients who underwent postoperative permanent pacemaker implantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study included all patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement in Sweden from 1997 to 2018. All patients who underwent primary surgical aortic valve replacement in Sweden and survived the first 30 days after surgical treatment were included. Patients who underwent preoperative permanent pacemaker implantation, concomitant surgical treatment for another valve, or emergency surgical treatment were excluded. Patients who underwent concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting or surgical treatment of the ascending aorta were included. Follow-up data were complete for all patients. Data were analyzed from October through December 2020. EXPOSURES Patients underwent implantation of a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator within 30 days after aortic valve replacement. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS Among 24 983 patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement, 849 patients (3.4\%) underwent permanent pacemaker implantation within 30 days after surgical treatment and 24 134 patients (96.6\%) did not receive pacemakers in that time. The mean (SD) age of the total study population was 69.7 (10.8) years, and 9209 patients were women (36.9\%). The mean (SD) and maximum follow-up periods were 7.3 (5.0) years and 22.0 years, respectively. At 10 years and 20 years after surgical treatment, the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival rates were 52.8\% and 18.0\% in the pacemaker group, respectively, and 57.5\% and 19.6\% in the nonpacemaker group, respectively. All-cause mortality was statistically significantly increased in the pacemaker group compared with the nonpacemaker group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95\% CI, 1.01-1.29; P = .03), and so was risk of heart failure hospitalization (HR, 1.58; 95\% CI, 1.31-1.89; P {\textless} .001). No statistically significant increase was found in the risk of endocarditis in the pacemaker group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that there were increased risks of all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalization among patients who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation after surgical aortic valve replacement, suggesting that these risks are important considerations, especially in an era when transcatheter aortic valve replacement is used in younger patients at lower risk of adverse surgical outcomes.

	abstract = {Background
              Prior studies showed that life expectancy in patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) was lower than in the general population. Explanations for this shorter life expectancy are unknown. The aim of this nationwide, observational cohort study was to investigate the cause‐specific death following surgical AVR.
            
            
              Methods and Results
              We included 33 018 patients who underwent primary surgical AVR in Sweden between 1997 and 2018, with or without coronary artery bypass grafting. The SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web‐System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence‐Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) register and other national health‐data registers were used to obtain and characterize the study cohort and to identify causes of death, categorized as cardiovascular mortality, cancer mortality, or other causes of death. The relative risks for cause‐specific mortality in patients who underwent AVR compared with the general population are presented as standardized mortality ratios. During a mean follow‐up period of 7.3 years (maximum 22.0 years), 14 237 (43\%) patients died. The cumulative incidence of death from cardiovascular, cancer‐related, or other causes was 23.5\%, 8.3\%, and 11.6\%, respectively, at 10 years, and 42.8\%, 12.8\%, and 23.8\%, respectively, at 20 years. Standardized mortality ratios for cardiovascular, cancer‐related, and other causes of death were 1.79 (95\% CI, 1.75–1.83), 1.00 (95\% CI, 0.97–1.04), and 1.08 (95\% CI, 1.05–1.12), respectively.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We found that life expectancy following AVR was lower than in the general population. Lower survival after AVR was explained by an increased relative risk of cardiovascular death. Future studies should focus on the role of earlier surgery in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and on optimizing treatment and follow‐up after AVR.
